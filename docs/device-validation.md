# Device Validation Gates

The first four control-plane phases can be built and exercised without an
iPhone, but the following claims require physical devices.

## Non-jailbroken device

- Build and sign an app containing `AppleTraceServer`.
- Confirm loopback access from mobile Safari while the app is foregrounded.
- Confirm the documented behavior when the app backgrounds or is suspended.
- Repeat text and binary capture tests on a genuine arm64e slice.
- Verify Local Network privacy behavior before enabling an opt-in LAN listener.

## Jailbroken device

- Install both rootless and rootful packages on matching environments.
- Validate at least ElleKit plus one libhooker/Substitute-compatible stack.
- Confirm the tweak is inert when the bundle id is absent from `EnabledBundles`.
- Enable one ordinary test app, restart it, and confirm Agent registration.
- Exercise start, stop, flush, and filter commands over `appletraced`.
- Confirm SpringBoard and unrelated apps remain stable after repeated crashes.
- Verify launchd restart, Agent reconnect, trace ownership, disk quotas, and
  uninstall cleanup.
- Repeat the arm64e ABI suite: nested sends, super dispatch, concurrency, stack
  arguments, floating-point values, and aggregate returns.

Simulator, macOS IPC, cross-compilation, and package inspection are useful
pre-device gates, but they do not replace these checks.
